# Eshaan_AIML_Assessment
In this coding assessment, we have been provided with two datasets - training and testing datasets. Each contains eight columns.
We have started our assessment by implementing exploratory data analysis. In this, we have displayed the dataset, removed null values, and plotted different variables in different ways like box plots, scatter plots, etc. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is an essential first step in data science, bridging the gap between raw data and meaningful analysis. It allows you to understand data types, and distributions, identify patterns and relationships, formulate hypotheses, prepare for data cleaning, choose appropriate techniques, and improve model performance by providing a comprehensive picture of your data's characteristics. For our prediction model, we have used the K-Folds Cross Validation technique. K-Fold Cross-Validation is a technique to assess how well a machine learning model performs on new data. It works by splitting the data into multiple folds, using each fold for validation once while training on the remaining folds. By averaging the performance scores across these folds, K-Fold reduces variance and provides a more reliable estimate of the model's generalizability, ultimately helping us build models that work well on unseen data. We have taken 10 K-folds for our model. We got a Root Mean Square value of 93.27 and a standard deviation of 35.27. Finally, we visualized and removed outliers from the data, specifically Sourcing Cost by various techniques such as z-score, box plots, and iqr, etc.
